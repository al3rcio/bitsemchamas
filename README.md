#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE> https://youtu.be/esBFbNQvUsM
#### Description: A website for a band called [**Bits em Chamas**](http://bitsemchamas.me "Site Bits em Chamas") using the Flask framework. We use the Heroku App for deploying. We also made a game using Unity engine, to promote one of their songs. The game itself is not in the scope of the website or the final project, but we have to use some Javascript logic to check if the user was trying to access via desktop or mobile, and in this last case, redirect the user, as for now the game just works properly on desketop. We also have some logic to handle de navbar menu's responsive with Javascript. To deal with boxes of texts, images and the YouTube canvas for different set of screens we use media queries in the CSS file.

Hi, my name is Alércio 

BRUNO 

Hi, my name is Bruno 

APJ 

We are here to show you our final project for CS50 

BRUNO  

It is a website using Flask as framework for this band called Bits em Chamas 

APJ 

It happens to be my band. The content it is only in Portuguese and for that I apologize myself. Well, that is a lot to cover, so let´s start it! 

BRUNO 

The “app.py” works as a basic router for navigation around the website. There is no much logic in there, as we really didn’t need a database or to collect user’s information, for example. 

APJ 

In a folder called templates we put all HTML files that we need it. In a file called “layout.html” we have our blueprint for those HTML files, all the metadata and our navbar. For that we used a lit bit of Javascript logic to make the menu responsive for smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets. 

BRUNO 

We also use some Javascript to handle when a mobile’s user tries to access the WebGL game, as for now it just works properly on desktop. And there is a similar logic around the CSS file to make the design responsive. So, for example, there are boxes containing images that shrink or expand depending from which platform the user is trying to access the page. Those content are in the Static folder. 

APJ  

The main page has a link to the game that I made to promote one of our last releases. And has links for each release, that contains texts about the song itself and canvas with our YouTube animations. We aim for this kind of minimal and clean design. I hope you guys enjoy it! 

BRUNO 

Thanks for watching and I have special thanks to Malan and his staff for those lessons. This was our CS50 final project!
