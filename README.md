#### Description: A website for a band called [**Bits em Chamas**](http://bitsemchamas.me "Site Bits em Chamas") using the Flask framework. We use the Heroku App for deploying. We also made a game using Unity engine, to promote one of their songs. The game itself is not in the scope of the website or the final project, but we have to use some Javascript logic to check if the user was trying to access via desktop or mobile, and in this last case, redirect the user, as for now the game just works properly on desketop. We also have some logic to handle de navbar menu's responsive with Javascript. To deal with boxes of texts, images and the YouTube canvas for different set of screens we use media queries in the CSS file.
